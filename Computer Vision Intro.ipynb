    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've found out by now, this tutorial is run using a jupyter notebook. This is an online programming environment which has been set up to take you through the tasks for this tutorial. Things to note with jupyter notebooks:\n",
    " - There are two types of 'cells', text cells like this one and code cells shown by the [?]: symbol at the side which contain the code that you'll run. As you go through feeel free to edit code cells and see what happens when you change them.\n",
    " - To run a cell press shift-enter or click the run button at the top of the page.\n",
    " - Sometimes you can accidentally enter editing mode of the text cells, if that happens just run the cell (shift-enter) to exit editing mode.\n",
    " - Some cells refer to variables created in other cells so make sure to run all cells in order\n",
    " \n",
    "This notebook is set up to run with the Python programming language. Different languages are structured and written differently which makes them good for different tasks, Python is a powerful language that's used a lot in research and is also relatively easy to start using.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial will give you a quick introduction to some core programming concepts and also some computer vision tasks. The first part will give and introduction to basic programming concepts, if you've done some programming before feel free to go over these quickly. The sections to this tutorial are:\n",

    "When programming, a piece of data has a a name and a data type. In this tutorial we'll use four data types:\n",
    " - int - Used for storing an integer, i.e. a whole number\n",
    " - float - Used for storing a floatimg point number, i.e. with decimal point\n",
    " - str - Used for storing a String, i.e. sequence of characters\n",
    " - list - Stores a comma separated list of data\n",
    " - array - Stores an array of data, we'll be using a library called 'numpy' which is useful for performing operations arrays. A library is some code written to perform specific operations, in this case the numpy library has useful inbuilt operation for dealing with large data arrays.\n",
    " \n",
    "In code you'll see two types of text, the actual code and comments. Comments are used to explain what's goin on in the code but aren't run by the program, in Python a comment is made by starting with the # symbol and are shown as italicised text. If you're not sure what some part of the code is doing try reading the comments for an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The print statement is used to display a variable or message to the user. The structure is print( *variable name* ) or print( \"*message*\" ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The type() function isused to retrieve the type of a variable, e.g. type(*variable*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the code cell below and make sure you understand where all the oupt statements are coming from."
